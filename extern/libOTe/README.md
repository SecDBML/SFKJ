A fast and portable C++11 library for Oblivious Transfer extension (OTe). The 
primary design goal of this library to obtain *high performance* while being 
*easy to use*.  This library currently implements:
 
* The semi-honest 1-out-of-2 OT [IKNP03].
* The semi-honest 1-out-of-2 Silent OT [[BCGIKRS19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1159.pdf).
* The semi-honest 1-out-of-2 Delta-OT [IKNP03],[[BLNNOOSS15]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/472.pdf).
* The semi-honest 1-out-of-N OT [[KKRT16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/799). 
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-2 OT [[KOS15]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546).
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-2 Delta-OT [[KOS15]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546),[[BLNNOOSS15]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/472.pdf).
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-N OT [[OOS16]](http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/933).
* The malicious secure approximate K-out-of-N OT [[RR16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/746).
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-2 base OT [NP01].
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-2 base OT [[CO15]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267.pdf) (Faster Linux ASM version disabled by default).
* The malicious secure 1-out-of-2 base OT [[MR19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/706.pdf) 
 
## Introduction
 
This library provides several different classes of OT protocols. First is the 
base OT protocol of Naor Pinkas [NP01]. This protocol bootstraps all the other
OT extension protocols.  Within the OT extension protocols, we have 1-out-of-2,
1-out-of-N and K-out-of-N, both in the semi-honest and malicious settings.

All implementations are highly optimized using fast SSE instructions and vectorization
to obtain optimal performance both in the single and multi-threaded setting. See 
the **Performance** section for a comparison between protocols and to other libraries. 
 
Networking can be performed using both the sockets provided by the library and 
external socket classes. See the [networking tutorial](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/57220fc45252d089a7fd90816144e447a2ce02b8/frontend_cryptoTools/Tutorials/Network.cpp#L264)
for an example.

## Example Code
A minimal working example showing how to perform `n` OTs using the IKNP protocol.
```cpp
void minimal()
{
    // Setup networking. See cryptoTools\frontend_cryptoTools\Tutorials\Network.cpp
    IOService ios;
    Channel senderChl = Session(ios, "localhost:1212", SessionMode::Server).addChannel();
    Channel recverChl = Session(ios, "localhost:1212", SessionMode::Client).addChannel();

    // The number of OTs.
    int n = 100;

    // The code to be run by the OT receiver.
    auto recverThread = std::thread([&]() {
        PRNG prng(sysRandomSeed());
        IknpOtExtReceiver recver;

        // Choose which messages should be received.
        BitVector choices(n);
        choices[0] = 1;
        //...

        // Receive the messages
        std::vector<block> messages(n);
        recver.receiveChosen(choices, messages, prng, recverChl);

        // messages[i] = sendMessages[i][choices[i]];
    });

    PRNG prng(sysRandomSeed());
    IknpOtExtSender sender;

    // Choose which messages should be sent.
    std::vector<std::array<block, 2>> sendMessages(n);
    sendMessages[0] = { toBlock(54), toBlock(33) };
    //...

    // Send the messages.
    sender.sendChosen(sendMessages, prng, senderChl);
    recverThread.join();
}
```

## Performance
 
The running time in seconds for computing n=2<sup>24</sup> OTs on a single Intel 
Xeon server (`2 36-cores Intel Xeon CPU E5-2699 v3 @ 2.30GHz and 256GB of RAM`)
as of 11/16/2016. All timings shown reflect a "single" thread per party, with the 
expection that network IO in libOTe is performed in the background by a separate thread.

## Install
 
The library is *cross platform* and has been tested on Windows, Mac and Linux. 
There is one mandatory dependency on [Boost 1.69](http://www.boost.org/) (networking),
and three **optional dependencies** on, [Miracl](https://www.miracl.com/),
[Relic](https://github.com/ladnir/relic/) or
[SimplestOT](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe/tree/master/SimplestOT) (Unix only)
for Base OTs. Any or all of these dependenies can be enabled. See below. 

 
### Windows

In `Powershell`, this will set up the project

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git
cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/win
getBoost.ps1 
cd ../../..
libOTe.sln
```

To see all the command line options, execute the program 

`frontend.exe` 

**Boost and visual studio 2017:**  If boost does not build with visual studio 2017 
follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41464356/build-boost-with-msvc-14-1-vs2017-rc). 

**Enabling [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) (for fast base OTs):**
 * Build the library:
```
git clone https://github.com/ladnir/relic.git
cd relic
cmake . -DMULTI=OPENMP -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=C:\libs  -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DRUNTIME=MT
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
```
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to include `#define ENABLE_RELIC`.

**Enabling Miracl (for base OTs):**
 * `cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/win`
 * `getMiracl.ps1 ` (If the Miracl script fails to find visual studio 2017,  manually open and build the Miracl solution.)
 * `cd ../../..`
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to include `#define ENABLE_MIRACL`.

**IMPORTANT:** By default, the build system needs the NASM compiler to be located
at `C:\NASM\nasm.exe`. In the event that it isn't, there are two options, install it, 
or enable the pure c++ implementation:
 * Remove  `cryptoTools/Crypto/asm/sha_win64.asm` from the cryptoTools Project.
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to remove `#define ENABLE_NASM`.



### Linux / Mac
 
 In short, this will build the project (without base OTs)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git
cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux
bash boost.get
cd ../../..
cmake .
make
```

This will build the minimum version of the library (wihtout base OTs). The libraries 
will be placed in `libOTe/lib` and the binary `frontend_libOTe` will be placed in 
`libOTe/bin` To see all the command line options, execute the program 
 
`./bin/frontend_libOTe`


**Enable Base OTs using:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_MIRACL=ON`: Build the library with integration to the
     [Miracl](https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL) library. Requires building miracl 
 `   cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux; bash miracl.get`.

 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_RELIC=ON`: Build the library with integration to the 
      [Relic](https://github.com/ladnir/relic/) library. Requires that
      relic is built with `cmake . -DMULTI=OPENMP` and installed. **Requires an older version of relic found here [Relic](https://github.com/ladnir/relic/)**
 * **Linux Only**: `cmake .  -DENABLE_SIMPLESTOT=ON`: Build the library with integration to the 
      [SimplestOT](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe/tree/master/SimplestOT) 
       library implementing a base OT. Also works with only relic but is slower.

**Other Options:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_CIRCUITS=ON`: Build the library with the circuit library enabled.
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_NASM=ON`: Build the library with the assembly base SHA1 implementation. Requires the NASM compiler.
 


**Note:** In the case that miracl or boost is already installed, the steps 
`cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux; bash boost.get` can be skipped and CMake will attempt 
to find them instead. Boost is found with the CMake findBoost package and miracl
is found with the `find_library(miracl)` command.
 


### Linking

 You can either `make install` on linux or link libOTe's source tree. In the latter 
 case, you will need to include the following:

1) .../libOTe
2) .../libOTe/cryptoTools
3) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost
4) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/miracl/miracl <i>(if enabled)</i>
5) [Relic includes] <i>(if enabled)</i>

and link:
1) .../libOTe/bin/liblibOTe.a
2) .../libOTe/bin/libcryptoTools.a
3) .../libOTe/bin/libSimplestOT.a    <i>(if enabled)</i>
3) .../libOTe/bin/libKyberOT.a       <i>(if enabled)</i>
4) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost/stage/lib/libboost_system.a
5) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/boost/stage/lib/libboost_thread.a
6) .../libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux/miracl/miracl/source/libmiracl.a <i>(if enabled)</i>
7) [Relic binary] <i>(if enabled)</i>

**Note:** On windows the linking paths follow a similar pattern.
